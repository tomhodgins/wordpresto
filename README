Welcome to the Wordpress Installer Script

This file was originally created for use on MediaTemple servers, and I'm certainly no programming expert here. There may well be ways to make this script much more useful to others on a wider variety of platforms than just MediaTemple's CentOS install.

You're welcome to add more to the file and fork it for your own use!

Enjoy,
